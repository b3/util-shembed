# Simple tool for inclusion of files inside shell script

This tool enable any file (text or binary) to be included in shell script. The
script is then able to list or extract it provided that it include some helper
functions.

In order to avoid shell conflicts, the included files are generally inserted
after an explicit 'exit 0' at the end of the script, but it is possible to
choose the location of inclusion. The tool enable binary file to be included
in base64 form.

## Use case

I create this file in order to publish simple shell wrappers embedding needed
configuration file (for `openvpn` and `pandoc`/`pdflatex`). That way I was
able to distribute a single command which do everything at once.

## Documentation

Full documentation is included in the script itself and can be displayed when
using the `--help` option.

I try to follow [semantic versionning](https://semver.org/) with patch version
starting with ISO date of modification.
